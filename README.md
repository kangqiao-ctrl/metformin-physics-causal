# Causal Prior-Embedded Physics-Informed Neural Networks
Data and code for the manuscript "Causal Prior-Embedded Physics-Informed Neural Networks and a Case Study on Metformin Transport in Porous Media."

This repository contains:
1. The augmented datasets generated by Phydrus/Hydrus-1D
   - **df_causal.parquet**:  Used for causal effect estimation;
   - **df_NN.parquet**: Used for neural network experiments.
2. A neural network framework /w causal weight initialization and causal regularization (Ref1)
   - **model_causal_reg.py**: Main program, PyTorch required
   - **set_random_seed.py**: Randomizer file.
3. [NNI](https://github.com/microsoft/nni) (Ref2) configuration related files. 
   - **search_space.json**: Example search space configuration for NNI
   - **config-example.yaml**: Example experiment configuration for NNI
   For a detailed instruction on NNI, please refer to [NNI Documentation](https://nni.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

Due to the size and format of the files mentioned below, we are considering uploading the following files associated with this paper to **Zenodo**:

1. Original Hydrus-1D files (from the column experiment data)
2. Phydrus files (For generating augmented data)
3. Our NNI experiment results (1,440 runs)

We will provide an update here before Sep 28, 2023.
